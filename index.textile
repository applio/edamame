          Beanstalk + Tokyo Tyrant = Edamame, a fast persistent distributed priority job queue
        </div>

        <p>
          "Edamame":http://bit.ly/edamame combines the "Beanstalk priority queue":http://bit.ly/beanstalkd with a "Tokyo Tyrant database"::http://bit.ly/ttyrant and "God monitoring":http://bit.ly/godmonitor to produce a persistent distributed priority job queue system.
          
          * fast, scalable, lightweight and distributed
          * persistent and recoverable
          * scalable up to your memory limits
          * queryable and enumerable jobs
          * named jobs
          * reasonably-good availability.
          
          Like beanstalk, it is a job queue, not just a message queue:
          * priority job scheduling, not just FIFO
          * Supports multiple queues ('tubes')
          * reliable scheduling: jobs that time out are re-assigned
          
          It includes a few nifty toys:
          * Scripts for "God":http://bit.ly/godmonitor to monitor and restart the daemons
          * Command-line management scripts to load. enumerate, empty, and show stats for the db+queue
          * The start of a lightweight web frontend in Sinatra.</p><h2>Dependencies</h2>
          <p>* Beanstalk
